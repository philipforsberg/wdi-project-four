#Â Book World

Hey, this is my app called Book World. I made this for my fourth and final project during my time at the Web Development Immersive course at [General Assembly.](https://generalassemb.ly/) The idea behind the app is that it is a platform for anyone who would like to leave reviews on the books they've read. And then later on add the another section for people to create and sign up for book-related events, such as book signings.

### Technologies and dependencies

-	Javascript
- React
- SCSS
- Bootstrap
- GitHub
- bcrypt
- Express
- Mongoose
- Morgan
- Axios
- JSON Web Tokens(JWT)


### What I liked about this project
I enjoyed that we got to learn React the week before this project-week, and being able to use it for our last project. Something I especially liked, was the way React makes you differ from the use of classical and functional components.

### Challenges faced
I only had a week to finish this project, and it started out quiet poorly, as I struggled to come up with a general idea for my project during the first day. So time management became an issue for me during this project, making me unable to finish all the features I wanted to.

### Ideas and plans for new features
First order of business would be to polish the homepage and everything regarding reviews, and then start to implement another feature revolving book related events. Things that should be done in the near future is to add a sorting and filtering option to the books, by name, year published, average rating from the readers and possibly more.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to thank all my teachers and co-students for the time I had at General Assembly, it was a great couple of months.
